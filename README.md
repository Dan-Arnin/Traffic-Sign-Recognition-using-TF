# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-using-TF
Android app to classify traffic signs

In todayâ€™s world the total number of active internet connections keeps increasing in an exponential level. This leads to an increase in the amount of data being transferred and hence the number of servers and databases have also been steadily increasing. As such, there has been a steady rise in unauthorized access to databases in servers and personal computers. 
It is of utmost importance to increase security measures and protect the data of the users stored in the database and prevent it from being used by unauthorized users. Our project aims to safeguard the data of the users by implementing two step authentication of users and the encryption of data that will be stored by the database. We also aim to provide a demonstration of the validation of the users email to safeguard the personal data of the users stored in databases and prevent SQL injections by unauthorized and malicious users.
